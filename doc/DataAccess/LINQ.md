### Cell Enumeration

With the cell
[selectors](/docs/manual/DataAccess/index.html#cell-selector),
we can select all cells of a specific type in the local memory
storage, wrapped in an `IEnumerable<CellType>` or
`IEnumerable<CellType_Accessor>`. This interface exposes basic
enumeration capabilities.  By itself, an
[`IEnumerable<T>`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.collections.ienumerable\(v=vs.110\).aspx)
is nothing more than a container where it can pump out elements one
after another -- similar to making iterations through the whole
database with cursors in other databases. It does not provide indexer
so we cannot take an element by specifying a subscript; there is no
rewind facilities so U-turn and revisiting an element is impossible.

### Enumerable Collection Operators

Custom logic can be performed on the cells when iterating through
them.  The .NET framework provides a set of static methods for
querying enumerable collections.  For a complete list of query
methods, refer to
[MSDN](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/system.linq.enumerable\(v=vs.110\).aspx).

With the extension methods provided by `System.Linq.Enumerable`, we
can use the cell selectors to manipulate data in a succinct
style. Instead of writing data processing logic in a `foreach` loop,
we can use the query interfaces to extract and aggregate information
in a declarative way. For example, instead of writing:

```C#
var sum = 0;
foreach(var n in Global.LocalStorage.Node_Selector())
    sum += n.val;
```

We can simply write:

```C#
var sum = Global.LocalStorage.Node_Selector().Sum(n=>n.val);
```

Or:

```C#
var sum = Global.LocalStorage.Node_Selector().Select(n=>n.val).Sum();
```

The code is kept away from intermediate states(e.g., the `sum`
variable in this example) and internal implementations. In
GE, certain query optimizations can be done automatically
by the query execution engine to leverage the indexes defined in
TSL. More specifically, it inspects the filters, extracts the
substring queries, and redirects them to proper substring query
interfaces generated by the TSL compiler.  The basic rule of
expression rewriting is as follows:

* `Select` operators  are not allowed to return _accessors_.

* For a `Where` operator, if there is an invocation of
  `String.Contains` on a string field of a cell and the field is
  indexed, the invocation sent to the inverted index module as a
  substring query.

* If a string container field (such as a list of strings or an array
  of strings) is marked as indexed, the TSL compiler will generate
  extension methods `ContainerType.Contains` which accepts same
  parameters as those on `System.String`. Invocation of these methods
  are also executed as inverted index queries.

**Note:** This subsection covers some system implementation details
  and you can safely skip it at your first reading.

GE translates the query on a selector as an _action_
performed over every cell of a specific type. Logically, there is no
much difference from implementing the logic imperatively. However,
with a certain pattern found in the query expression, GE
will rewrite the expression for optimization.

Let's view a query expression as a chain `S->E_1->E_2->...->E_n`,
where `S` denotes a selector and `E_i` denotes an query operator (a
method from `System.Linq.Enumerable`). Let `W_i` denote the `Where`
operators, and `S` denote the first `Select` operators in the chain.
GE will overlook all query operators after `S` since after
a `Select` operator the data is projected into something that is not
defined in the TSL (projecting accessor to accessor is not allowed),
and thus not available in any substring indices defined in TSL. Now,
let `W_1,...,W_m` denote all the `Where` operators before `S` (not
necessarily consecutive). These are all the conditional filters
applied onto the native cells(without projection into other types), so
we combine them together as `W1 and W2 and ... and Wn` and regard this
expression as a whole. GE then examines the expression and
aggregates `String.Contains` invocations on cell fields into a
expression tree.  All the expressions under a `NOT` operator are
ignored. This is because making a substring query then obtain its
compliment set would usually yield too many results to process, in
which case we would have better ignored this rewriting.

### Language-Integrated Query (LINQ)

[LINQ](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb397897.aspx) is a
convenient way to query a data collection.  The expression power of
LINQ is equivalent to those extension methods provided by the
`System.Linq.Enumerable` class, only more convenient to use. The
following example demonstrates LINQ in GE versus its
imperative equivalent:

```C#
/*==========================  LINQ version ==============================*/ 
var result = from node in Global.LocaStorage.Node_Accessor_Selector()     
             where node.color == Color.Red && node.degree > 5             
             select node.CellID.Value;                                    
/*==========================  Imperative version ========================*/
var result = Global.LocalStorage.Node_Accessor_Selector()                      
            .Where(  node => node.color == Color.Red && node.degree > 5 )
            .Select( node => node.CellID.Value  );
``` 

Both versions will be translated to the same binary code; the elements
in the LINQ expression will eventually be one-to-one mapped to the
imperative interfaces provided in `System.Linq.Enumerable` class. But,
with LINQ we can write cleaner code. For example, if we try to write
an imperative equivalent for the following LINQ expression, a nested lambda expression must be used.

```C#
 var positive_feedbacks = from user in Global.LocalStorage.User_Accessor_Selector()
                          from comment in user.comments
                          where comment.rating == Rating.Excellent
                          select new 
                          {
                            uid = user.CellID,
                            pid = comment.ProductID
                          };
```

### Parallel LINQ (PLINQ)

PLINQ[(MSDN)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/dd460688\(v=vs.110\).aspx)
is a parallel implementation of LINQ. It runs the query on multiple
processors simultaneously whenever possible.  Calling _AsParallel()_
on a _selector_ will turn it into a parallel enumerable container that
works with PLINQ.

{% comment %}
However, due to the limitations (described below), using PLINQ over
cell accessors natively, so the `AsParallel()` interface of cell
accessor selectors are overridden and returns a
`Trinity.Linq.PLINQWrapper` that delays an unsupported PLINQ query to
the next query operator(until it's supported).

### Limitations

There is a limitation of `IEnumerable<T>`: `IDisposable` elements are
not disposed along the enumeration. However, disposing a cell accessor
after use is crucial in GE, and **a non-disposed cell
accessor will result in the target cell being locked permanently**.

This has led to the design decision made in GE, that we actively
dispose a cell accessor when the user code finishes using the accessor
in the enumeration loop. As a result, it is not allowed for a user to
capture the value/reference of an accessor during an enumeration and
store it somewhere for later use. Because the reference will be
destroyed and the value will be invalidated immediately after the
enumeration loop body, any operation done to the stored
value/reference will cause data corruption or system crash. This is
the root cause for the following limitations:

* Select operator cannot return cell accessors, because the accessors
  are disposed as soon as the loop is done.

* LINQ operators that cache elements (such as `join`, `group by`) are
  not supported.

* PLINQ caches some elements and then distributes them to multiple
   cores, therefore it will not work with cell accessors. It does work
   with cell object selectors, though.

* Although enumeration operation will not block the whole database, it
does employ trunk-level locks.  Compound LINQ selectors with join
operations are not supported, because the inner loop will try to
obtain the trunk lock already taken by the outer one.
