### Cell Enumeration

With the cell [selectors](/docs/manual/DataAccess/index.html#cell-selector), we
can select the cells of a given type in the local memory storage via
`IEnumerable<CellType>` or `IEnumerable<CellType_Accessor>`.  An
`IEnumerable<T>` is nothing more than a container where it can pump out elements
one after another. This interface exposes basic enumeration capabilities. It
does not provide indexer so we cannot take an element by specifying a subscript.
There is no rewind facilities so U-turn and revisiting an element is impossible.

### Enumerable Collection Operators

Custom logic can be performed on the cells when iterating through them.  .NET
provides a set of static methods for querying enumerable collections.  For a
complete list of query methods, refer to the doc for the [Enumerable<T>
interface](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.generic.ienumerable-1?view=net-6.0).

With the extension methods provided by `System.Linq.Enumerable`, we can use the
cell selectors to manipulate data in an elegant manner. Instead of writing data
processing logic in a `foreach` loop, we can use the query interfaces to extract
and aggregate information in a declarative way. For example, instead of writing:

```C#
var sum = 0;
foreach(var n in Global.LocalStorage.Node_Selector())
    sum += n.val;
```

We can simply write:

```C#
var sum = Global.LocalStorage.Node_Selector().Sum(n=>n.val);
```

Or:

```C#
var sum = Global.LocalStorage.Node_Selector().Select(n=>n.val).Sum();
```

The code eliminates the need for intermediate states (e.g., the `sum` variable
in this example) and saves some implementation details. In GE, certain query
optimizations can be done automatically by the query execution engine to
leverage the indexes defined in TSL. Specifically, the execution engine inspects
the filters, extracts the substring queries, and dispatches them to the proper
substring query interfaces generated by the TSL compiler.

Some rules are followed by GE for expression rewriting:

* `Select` operators are not allowed to return _accessors_.

* For a `Where` operator, if there is an invocation of `String.Contains` on a
  string field of a cell and the field is indexed, the invocation sent to the
  inverted index module as a substring query.

* If a string container field (such as a list of strings or an array of strings)
  is marked as indexed, the TSL compiler will generate extension methods
  `ContainerType.Contains` which accepts same parameters as those on
  `System.String`. Invocation of these methods are also executed as inverted
  index queries.

**Note:** This subsection covers some system implementation details
  and you can safely skip it at your first reading.

GE translates the query on a selector as an _action_ performed over every cell
of a specific type. Logically, there is no much difference from implementing the
logic imperatively. However, with a certain pattern found in the query
expression, GE will rewrite the expression for optimization.

Let's view a query expression as a chain `S->E_1->E_2->...->E_n`, where `S`
denotes a selector and `E_i` denotes an query operator (a method from
`System.Linq.Enumerable`). Let `W_i` denote the `Where` operators, and `S`
denote the first `Select` operators in the chain. GE will overlook all query
operators after `S` since after a `Select` operator the data is projected into
something that is not defined in the TSL (projecting accessor to accessor is not
allowed), and thus not available in any substring indices defined in TSL. Now,
let `W_1,...,W_m` denote all the `Where` operators before `S` (not necessarily
consecutive). These are all the conditional filters applied onto the native
cells(without projection into other types), so we combine them together as `W1
and W2 and ... and Wn` and regard this expression as a whole. GE then examines
the expression and aggregates `String.Contains` invocations on cell fields into
a expression tree.  All the expressions under a `NOT` operator are ignored. This
is because making a substring query then obtain its compliment set would usually
yield too many results to process, in which case we would have better ignored
this rewriting.

### Language-Integrated Query (LINQ)

[LINQ](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/)
provides a convenient way of querying a data collection. The expressive power of
LINQ is equivalent to the extension methods provided by the
`System.Linq.Enumerable` class, only more convenient to use. The following
example demonstrates LINQ in GE versus its imperative equivalent:

```C#
/*==========================  LINQ version ==============================*/
var result = from node in Global.LocaStorage.Node_Accessor_Selector()
             where node.color == Color.Red && node.degree > 5
             select node.CellID.Value;

/*==========================  Imperative version ========================*/
var result = Global.LocalStorage.Node_Accessor_Selector()
            .Where(  node => node.color == Color.Red && node.degree > 5 )
            .Select( node => node.CellID.Value  );
```

Both versions will be translated to the same binary code; the elements in the
LINQ expression will eventually be mapped to the imperative interfaces provided
by `System.Linq.Enumerable` class. But, with LINQ we can write cleaner code. For
example, if we try to write an imperative equivalent for the following LINQ
expression, a nested lambda expression must be used.

```C#
 var positive_feedbacks = from user in Global.LocalStorage.User_Accessor_Selector()
                          from comment in user.comments
                          where comment.rating == Rating.Excellent
                          select new
                          {
                            uid = user.CellID,
                            pid = comment.ProductID
                          };
```

### Parallel LINQ (PLINQ)

[PLINQ](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/parallel-programming/introduction-to-plinq)
is a parallel implementation of LINQ. It runs the query on multiple processors
simultaneously whenever possible. Calling _AsParallel()_ on a _selector_ turns
it into a parallel enumerable container that works with PLINQ.

{% comment %}

However, due to the limitations (described below), using PLINQ over cell
accessors natively, so the `AsParallel()` interface of cell accessor selectors
are overridden and returns a `Trinity.Linq.PLINQWrapper` that delays an
unsupported PLINQ query to the next query operator(until it's supported).

{% endcomment %}

### Limitations

There is a limitation of `IEnumerable<T>`: `IDisposable` elements are not
disposed during the enumeration. However, disposing a cell accessor after use is
crucial, **an undisposed cell accessor will result in the target cell
being locked permanently**.

This has led to the design decision that we actively dispose a cell accessor
when the user code finishes using the accessor in the enumeration loop. As a
result, it is not allowed to capture the value/reference of an accessor during
an enumeration and store it somewhere for later use. The reference will be
destroyed and the value will be invalidated immediately after the enumeration
loop. Any operation done to the stored value/reference will cause data
corruption or system crash. This is the root cause for the following
limitations:

* _Select_ operator cannot return cell accessors, because the accessors are
  disposed as soon as the loop is done.

* LINQ operators that cache elements, such as `join`, `group by`, are not
  supported.

* PLINQ caches some elements and distributes them to multiple cores, therefore
   it will not work with cell accessors. It does work with cell object
   selectors, though.

* Although an enumeration operation does not lock the whole local storage, it
does take the trunk-level locks.  Compound LINQ selectors with join operations
are not supported, because the inner loop will try to obtain the trunk lock that
has been taken by the outer one.
