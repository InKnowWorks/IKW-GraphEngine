This repository contains the source code of [Microsoft Graph Engine][graph-engine] and its graph
query language -- [Language Integrated Knowledge Query][likq] (LIKQ).

Microsoft Graph Engine is a distributed in-memory data processing engine,
underpinned by a strongly-typed in-memory key-value store and a general-purpose distributed computation
engine.

[LIKQ][likq-gh]
is a versatile graph query language built atop Graph Engine. It
combines the capability of fast graph exploration with the flexibility
of lambda expressions. Server-side computations can be expressed in
lambda expressions, embedded in LIKQ, and executed on the Graph Engine servers during graph traversal.

## Recent changes

The main version number is bumped to 3.0 to reflect the recent toolchain updates.
- .NET from 3.1 to 6.0
- .NET Framework from 4.61 to 4.8
- Visual Studio from 2017/2019 to 2022

One goal of Graph Engine 3.0 is to bring the system up-to-date and make it slimmer.
Some obsolete or outdated modules and tools will be removed from the build pipeline.

## Getting started

Recommended operating system: Windows 10 or Ubuntu 20.04.

### Building on Windows

Download and install [Visual Studio][vs] with the following "workloads" and "individual components" selected:
- The ".NET desktop development" and "Desktop development with C++" workloads.
- The ".NET Portable Library targeting pack" individual component.

Open a powershell window, run `tools/build.ps1` for generating multi-targeting nuget packages.
The script has been tested on Windows 10 (21H2) with Visual Studio 2022.

### Building on Linux

Install g++, cmake, and libssl-dev. For example, on Ubuntu, simply run

```shell
sudo apt install g++ cmake libssl-dev
```

Install [.NET SDK x64 6.0][dotnet6-on-ubuntu20-04] and run:

```shell
bash tools/build.sh
```

The build script has been tested on Ubuntu 20.04 with g++ 9.4.0.

### Using the built packages

You can find the built nuget packages `build/GraphEngine**._version_.nupkg` in the `build/` folder.
The folder `build/` will be registered as a local NuGet repository and the local package cache for
`GraphEngine.Core` will be cleared. After the packages are built, run `dotnet restore` to use the newly built packages.

### Running your first Graph Engine app

Go to the `samples/Friends/Friends` folder, execute `dotnet restore` and `dotnet run` to run the sample project.
